           <b>Conceived</b>  as the mouthpiece of India's freedom movement, Mathrubhumi is one of the front-runners among
            the Malayalam newspapers. The first copy of Mathrubhumi was published on 18th of March 1923 -- the day before the
            first anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's arrest for the first time by the British police. Led by K.P.Kesava Menon, the
            prominent freedom fighter, as Editor and K. MadhavanNair as Managing Director, Mathrubhumi was envisaged for spreading
            the message of the great National Movement. In the beginning, the paper was published a week and had just one edition
            from Kozhikode (Calicut). A newspaper born out of relentless passion of freedom fighters, Mathrubhumi went on to become
            an inalienable part of Kerala's social fabric.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now with sixteen editions- ten in Kerala , ones in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangaluru, 
            Chennai, Dubai and Doha- it has an impressive circulation of over 1.5 million copies.
            The history of Mathrubhumi is synonymous with the history of the state's freedom 
            movement, and that of Indian National Congress. Before Mathrubhumi came into being, 
            there were four Malayalam News Papers ('Kerala Patrika', 'Kozhikodan Manorama' , 'Kerala Sanchari
            ' and 'Mithavadi ') and three English News Papers ('Champion', 'West Coast Reformer 'and 'Spectator'), 
            which were being published from Kozhikode. But none of these papers favoured the freedom movement spearheaded 
            by the Congress. Instead, they supported the British Rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>K.P Kesava Menon</i> , who was then Secretary of Kerala State
            Congress Committee, realized the urgent need for a pro-freedom
            movement publication from the Malabar region. And he, along with
            his confidants like K.Madhavan Nair, Kuroor Neelakandan 
            Nampoothirippad, K. Kesavan Nair and P. Achuthan, resolved to 
            register The Mathrubhumi Printing and Publishing Company Limited 
            with an authorized capital of Rs.1, 00,000/- in 20,000 shares of 
            Rs.5/- each. However, the Company was able to collect an amount of
            Rs.15, 000/- only.
            And the registration took place on 15th of February 1922.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1979 the Company launched Grihalakshmi, a magazine exclusively
            for the women of Kerala which was later converted to a Fortnightly.
            Chitrabhumi in 1982, a magazine catering the interests of the 
            Malayalam movie buffs, followed it. The weekly for job prospects
            Thozhilvartha was launched in 1992. After two years, it was the
            turn of Mathrubhumi Sports Masika, a monthly exclusively for the 
            sports lovers. Balabhumi for children came out in 1996 and in 1997 
            the health magazine in Malayalam, Mathrubhumi ArogyaMasika happened. In the
            year 2008 Mathrubhumi started publishing a Travel Magazine "Mathrubhumi Yathra"
            for the travel loving Malayalees. "Mathrubhumi Minnaminni" a weekly kids publication
            started publishing from 2010. "Cartoon Plus", a fortnightly started publishing in 2010 which
            was later replaced with a monthly "Mathrubhumi Chithrakatha". Our Annual "Mathrubhumi Year Book " 
            is published both in Malayalam and English. We have started printing a Celebrity lifestyle Magazine 
            "Mathrubhumi Star & Style" 
            from the year 2013 replacing our film weekly Chithrabhumi.
